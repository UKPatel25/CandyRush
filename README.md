# Introduction
Candy Rush is a small game made in java. This game is very simple and the first step for the java GUI game. This game is also a best example of multithreading in java. In this game, balls are constantly falling and at the bottom, one basket is there and catches the balls. You have five lifes if life became zero then end of the game. After some thinking, I automate this game :). And now the computer is playing this #game.
